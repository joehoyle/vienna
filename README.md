# Vienna

Vienna is an open-source native iOS app for interacting with your WordPress
site.

Vienna is written in React Native and uses the [WP REST API](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API)
to interact with your WordPress install.

## Requirements

### Local development setup
- Xcode 7 or higher.
- NPM 3.x.
- Node 4.x.

### WordPress site
- WordPress 4.7 or higher.
- [WP REST API OAuth 1 plugin](https://github.com/WP-API/OAuth1)
- [WP REST API Broker Auth Client](https://github.com/WP-API/broker-client)

## Development

### Project setup
- Clone the repository.
- In Terminal, change to the project folder, and run `npm install`.

### Building and running the app

### Connecting to your WordPress site

#### Using a site with the Authentication Broker
